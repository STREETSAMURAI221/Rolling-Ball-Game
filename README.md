# Rolling-Ball-Game
The game will be 3D, you will control a ball by adding momentum to move it in a desired direction. you want to collect a number of (Gems, coins, items) to clear a level. you will need to use the physics of the game to solve each level ala super monkey ball style gameplay.

what I want to learn:
1. more experience with 3d.
2. To push to a repository after every change
3. more physics experience.
4. To avoid Scope creep and stick to a plan.
5. How to swap textures/materials.
6. How to build for mobile.
